            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence of inflation, 
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the 
            Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

        <p class="full_des1 full">
            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p class="full_des1">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
            the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
             could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
              the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">

              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
               pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out 
               all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">

                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box 
                around it.
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">
        
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the 
        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
         right.
        </p>
        <p class="full_des1">
         Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at 
         the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
         for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves —
          the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of 
          a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>
        <p class="full_des1">
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, 
          wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
          discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open 
          vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p class="full_des1">
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in 
          space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
           cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe 
           there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot 
           of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>
        <p class="full_des1">
            ‘As Big as It Gets’
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
             beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, 
              according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of 
              the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
              in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation 
              that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
               and as hot as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="full_des1">
               Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background 
               Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific 
               briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to 
               The Astrophysical Journal.

            <p class="full_des1">
                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
                
                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such
                 a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                 “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
                 The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations
                  and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered 
                  drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor
                   at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
                    that night in 1979), in his office last week.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                    “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” 
                    said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
                     telescopes.

                     Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most 
                     popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to 
                     go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague 
                     and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne 
                     to tell him the news.

            <p class="full_des1">
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we 
                did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
                 it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                 Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still 
                 hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
                 By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
                  news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                  Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays 
                  true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                  John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                   project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the 
                   results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                   Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash 
                   of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would
                    eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                     noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the 
                     cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other 
                     assumptions about the universe.

                    <p class="full_des1">
                     “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                     
                     Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own 
                     findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from 
                     balloons, mountaintops and space.

                     Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, 
                     which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 
                     50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.

                    <p class="full_des1">
                     Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is 
                     one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive 
                     radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing 
                     conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock 
                     of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                      Kovac said.He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been 
                      hooked ever since,” he said.

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
                 meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                  another.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                  This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
                   inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another
                    as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, 
                    theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have 
                    little arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p class="full_des1">
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences 
                    in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically 
                    a giant superconducting thermometer.

                    “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.

                <p class="full_des1">
                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning
                     up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying 
                     that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.

                     So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking
                      about going any deeper into the past.

                      We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
                       inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of
                        the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
